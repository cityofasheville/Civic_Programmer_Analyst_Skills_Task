## Installation

  npm install
  npm start

Go to http://localhost:3000

## Future Considerations

* Break out and publish the individual visualization components and the dashboard component as NPM modules.

* I made the datasets an array so that more sophisticated visualizations and analyses involving multiple datasets can be done.

* Obviously the dashboard component needs to be more configurable.
